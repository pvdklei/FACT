5,"I have achieved several notable accomplishments during my training and projects. Despite my limited experience, I have actively pursued opportunities to showcase my skills and demonstrate my dedication to the field of UI/UX design.

1.Successful Completion of UI/UX Design Courses: I successfully completed comprehensive UI/UX design courses, where I gained a solid foundation in design principles, user research methodologies, wireframing, prototyping, and interaction design. This achievement demonstrates my commitment to learning and developing the necessary skills to excel in the field.

2.Project Contributions: During my courses, I actively participated in various design projects, both individually and as part of a team. I successfully collaborated with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders to deliver well-designed user interfaces and engaging user experiences. These projects allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, demonstrating my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly designs.

3.Positive Feedback from Course Instructors and Peers: Throughout my training, I received positive feedback from instructors and peers on my design work. They commended my attention to detail, creativity, and ability to incorporate user feedback into my design iterations. This feedback validates my capabilities and motivates me to continue improving and refining my design skills.

I have actively pursued self-study, attended webinars, and engaged with design communities to stay up-to-date with industry trends, new tools, and emerging design practices. This dedication to personal growth showcases my eagerness to evolve as a UI/UX Designer.

Although I have yet to accumulate professional work experience, these achievements demonstrate my determination, willingness to learn, and ability to deliver quality design solutions. As I embark on my professional journey, I am excited to further build upon these accomplishments and contribute to impactful projects as a dedicated UI/UX Designer.
For six months, I worked as a freelance UI/UX designer, where I was responsible for developing and creating unique user interfaces for various clients. My role involved analyzing client requirements, conducting user research, creating information architecture, conducting user experience testing, and creating prototypes. I also participated in iterative processes and collaborated with developers to ensure high-quality end products.

During my freelance work, I developed my skills in design and user experience, gained a deep understanding of the product creation process, and learned to effectively communicate with clients and manage project timelines. As a result of my work, my clients received distinctive and appealing designs that enhanced their user experience and improved conversion rates.

My freelance experience validates my ability to work independently, organize my work, and achieve results within given deadlines. I am ready to apply these skills and experiences to a new team, to help achieve its goals and bring long-term value to the company.
1. User-Centric Approach: I strive to work in a team that values user needs and expectations. I believe that the best design solutions arise from a deep understanding of the target audience and a commitment to providing them with a predominantly positive user experience.
2.Opportunities for Professional Growth: I would like to work in a company that provides opportunities for development and advancement. I am committed to continuous improvement and participation in training, conferences, and events to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in UI/UX design.
3.Collaboration and Communication: I excel at working in a team and openly communicating with other stakeholders, such as developers, product managers, and business analysts. My goal is to build productive relationships and ensure that all team members understand each other and work together to deliver high-quality design."
6,"During my continuous studies, I performed many interesting projects. Namely: 
- redesign of the site of the roofing materials plant (the site turned from an outdated and non-functional multi-page site into a modern, convenient landing page with an interesting structure); 
- a landing page for a tea studio (the main task of the project was completed - to make an attention-grabbing, stylized site where a potential client will not only find the necessary information about the studio, but also get aesthetic and cultural satisfaction); 
- online store of board games (elements of work with AI were used); 
- Ukrainian cinema network Multiplex application improvement project (a detailed ux research was conducted and options for solving the main inconveniences of the application were proposed).
For the past eleven months, I have been constantly developing in the field of Ui/Ux design. During this period, I perfectly mastered Figma (component, variants, auto layout, constraints) - the main tool of a web designer. I also use Photoshop and Illustrator in my work. I have the skills to work on the Webflow site designer and the After Effects motion program.
I never stop there. Therefore, I constantly continue my development in the field of web design. I am from Ukraine, so like all Ukrainians, I know how to fight and achieve my goal. I also add a piece of my Ukrainian soul to each of my projects. The project only benefits from this, because it has its own original, creative and unique style.

Now I want to develop myself in UI/UX design because I want to combine art/design and front-end development. I have learned Figma in a short time and I want to dive deeper and deeper into this topic, I can’t stop and see this as my calling."

Gifts&Fleurs 
A flower and gift delivery app where you can schedule delivery for the upcoming birthdays of your friends, relatives or anyone else.

Mr.Cleaner
I did this project in a team of three people. Our goal was to develop a user-friendly design for a cleaning company. We looked at competitors, selected references and analysed the target audience. Within the team, we discussed which features of our product could be included in the first iteration. We built a user flow diagram for our resource. Based on this, we created page layouts. I designed the main page. Then we did the linking and adaptation to different types of devices. In the end, we came up with a user-friendly and modern design that meets all the needs of the user.

It also has the ability to find a match between lost and found animals within a given search radius (how it works: you set the search radius, the map shows pairs of markers that have matched according to the species+breed criteria)

Application for booking tables in restaurants.
Goal: A graphical restaurant reservation/booking application that allows you to check the layout, restaurant hall, choose your preferred seats/table and reserve a table for a specific time.
Also, such functions as choosing the number of guests, choosing the zone (for smoking, in the yard, next to the children's room, quiet zone, near the window) were added. There is also an additional service (a high chair, holiday decorations, a bowl and a bed for animals, a vase for flowers). Also, in the application, you can choose a cafe, restaurant, bar, bakery with different prices and menus, and you can also pay the bill.

As a web designer, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that involved both website redesign and UX/UI design. One of the projects that I worked on was the redesign of the Children's Music School website. The main goal of this project was to create a new landing page for the website that would be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

To achieve this goal, I first conducted a thorough analysis of the existing website to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Based on my findings, I created a detailed wireframe of the new landing page, which included a news block and a prominent call to action. I also paid close attention to the color scheme and typography of the new design, ensuring that they were both consistent with the school's brand identity.

Once the wireframe was approved, I began working on the visual design of the landing page, paying close attention to the user experience. I made sure that the page was easy to navigate and that all the important information was easily accessible to the user. I also incorporated responsive design principles to ensure that the page looked great on all devices.

Another project that I worked on as a UX/UI designer was Pet-Saver-Hub, a web service project for rescuing lost and found animals. In this project, my main focus was on creating a user-friendly interface that would allow users to easily search for lost or found pets.

To achieve this, I conducted user research to identify the key pain points that users experienced when trying to find lost or found pets. Based on this research, I created a detailed user flow and wireframe of the website, ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate. I also incorporated interactive elements, such as a map feature, to make it easier for users to find lost or found pets in their area.

Overall, my experience as a web and UX/UI designer has allowed me to develop a range of skills, including wireframing, visual design, user research, and responsive design. Through my work on projects such as the Children's Music School website redesign and Pet-Saver-Hub, I have gained valuable experience in developing user-friendly designs that meet the needs of both clients and users.
I would like to have the opportunity to develop my skills in UI/UX design and contribute to projects that have significance and impact people's lives. I am expecting to collaborate with professionals who can help me grow and learn new things. I would be delighted to participate in challenging projects that allow me to develop my creative potential and keep up with the latest design technologies and trends. I value communication and teamwork, which ensure effective work and achieve results.
Furthermore, I intend to actively interact with users and collect their feedback to improve the user experience. I understand that creativity and attention to detail play a crucial role in the design process and I am ready to put in maximum effort to ensure the high quality of my work."

Hi,

Design is my life.
I enjoy every pixel I create, every user delight and ah-ah moments. My dream is that design is taught in schools. If you need someone who will take your project apart, find the weak points, and improve it to perfection – that's me.

I had my own studio with 20 employees, with built processes for sales, management, hiring, and project creation. But I closed it in order to do what I loved: creating designs on my own.

I try not to do development, but to better understand how design works and understand that I took courses in frontend (HTML5/CSS3/TypeScript/Vue.js) and backend (Python, Swift).

Unfortunately, the lion's share of my best work is under a nondisclosure contract. But at an interview I am willing to show some of them (in the direction you are interested in).

Real estate site redesign
This project is a website redesign for a real estate company located in Destin, Florida.
The design of the existing site looks outdated, is not very user-friendly, has poor quality photos and does not contain information important to customers (for example, a user-friendly feedback or property valuation). Therefore, the goal of the project was to create a modern and convenient design that could attract potential customers.
Before starting the redesign, research and analysis of competitors was carried out. This helped to understand which successful solutions can be used for our project. Also, after studying social networks and customer feedback about real estate companies, 3 user personas and a customer journey map were compiled.

2. View and choose excursions by category. Also add filters;
3. The possibility of registration via e-mail, Google or Facebook;

Working more than 5 years in Autotransport Company in the US, based out of Florida. With a local office in Dnipro. Each transportation request for my clients is a separate project for me. From Start to Finish. I have to meet both, the client's and driver's needs for each order (deadlines, price, contract terms, specifics of the service). That makes my job similar to the job of a Project Manager. With the only difference in the final product/service that is provided.
